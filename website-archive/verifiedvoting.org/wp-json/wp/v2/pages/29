Hellman, Ph.D. is Professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University and best known for his invention, with Diffie and Merkle, of public key cryptography. This technology allows electronic banking and other secure transactions on the Internet, and protects literally trillions of dollars daily. Prof. Hellman has been a long-time contributor to the computer security debate, starting with his efforts in the mid 1970s to improve the security level of the Data Encryption Standard (DES). In the mid 1990s he served on the National Research Council\u2019s Committee to Study National Cryptographic Policy, whose main recommendations have since been implemented. His current project focuses on reducing the unacceptable level of risk inherent in nuclear deterrence. Prof. Hellman\u2019s many awards include the ACM Turing Award in 2015, election to the National Academy of Engineering, induction as an inaugural member of the Cyber Security Hall of Fame, EFF\u2019s Pioneer Award, and three \u201coutstanding professor\u201d awards from minority student organizations..<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6946\" src=\"https:\/\/verifiedvoting.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Neal_McBurnett_PC001-scaled-e1617644450262-300x287.jpg\" alt=\"Neal McBurnett\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Neal McBurnett<\/h3>\n<p><a class=\"blue-btn\" href=\"#neal\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"neal\" class=\"bio-overlay\">\n<div class=\"bio-popup\">\n<h2>Neal McBurnett<\/h2>\n<p><a class=\"close\" href=\"#directors2\">\u00d7<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<p>Neal McBurnett is an independent consultant in election integrity, security and data science.

He is also the New York State representative on the U.S. Election Assistance Commission Standards Board. Before assuming his responsibilities at the State Board of Elections, he served as commissioner of the New York City Board of Elections. He is an experienced election lawyer having served as the Co-Chair of the Law Committee of the New York Democratic Committee from 1982 to 1993 and as the Chairman of the Election Law Committee of the New York County Lawyers Association.When he was first appointed to the New York City Board in 1993, Commissioner Kellner was the very first election official to call for a voter verifiable paper audit trail for electronic voting machines, a principle now enshrined not only in New York law, but in the election codes of a majority of the states throughout the nation. While leading the opposition to unverifiable electronic machines, Commissioner Kellner was instrumental in promoting new technology for scanning absentee and provisional ballots. He drafted model procedures to open the process of canvassing ballots to public scrutiny and convinced his fellow commissioners to adopt rules that provided meaningful due process in ballot challenges. He has been an outspoken advocate for improving the voting process in New York while insisting on transparency, verifiability and uniformity in voting procedures. Doug is a partner in the law firm, Kellner Herlihy Getty &amp; Friedman LLP, where he specializes in complex international asset recovery litigation. He is the Chair of the North America Region of FraudNet, an organization of experts formed by the International Chamber of Commerce to assist in fraud recovery and tracing of assets.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner el_id=&#8221;advisors10&#8243;][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3>Joseph Kiniry, Ph.D.<\/h3>\n<p><a class=\"blue-btn\" href=\"#kiniry\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"kiniry\" class=\"bio-overlay\">\n<div class=\"bio-popup\">\n<h2>Joseph Kiniry, Ph.D.<\/h2>\n<p><a class=\"close\" href=\"#advisors9\">\u00d7<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"content\">Dr. Joseph Kiniry is a Principal Scientist at Galois.

She did her Bachelor\u2019s Degree at The University of Melbourne and her Ph.D. in cryptography and game theory at Stanford University. Her main research interest is in electronic voting, with a focus on cryptographic schemes for end-to-end verifiable elections and a special interest in complex voting schemes such as IRV and STV. She was a major contributor to the Victorian Electoral Commission\u2019s end-to-end verifiable electronic voting project, the first of its kind to run at a state level anywhere in the world. She has been part of two separate research teams that found serious security vulnerabilities in the NSW iVote Internet voting system (first in 2015 and again in Western Australia in 2017). Her other work includes the development of rigorous and efficient auditing methods for complex voting schemes.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3>Michael Ubell<\/h3>\n<p><a class=\"blue-btn\" href=\"#ubell\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"ubell\" class=\"bio-overlay\">\n<div class=\"bio-popup\">\n<h2>Michael Ubell<\/h2>\n<p><a class=\"close\" href=\"#advisors14\">\u00d7<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"content\">Michael Ubell has retired from a 40 year career developing database and transaction management systems.
