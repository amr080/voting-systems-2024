Any system that does not include a paper record or a step for voter verification should not be used. Some states and local jurisdictions are still using unreliable and insecure electronic voting systems, while others primarily use hand-marked paper ballots.

In jurisdictions that use optical scanners voters indicate their selections by filling in an oval, completing an arrow or filling in a box for each selection on their ballot. Other voters may use a Ballot Marking Device (BMD), some of which encode voters\u2019 selections into QR codes or bar codes. Ballots are then scanned on hand-fed optical scanners in the polling place or are collected in a ballot box to be scanned at a central location on hand-fed or high-speed batch-fed optical scanners. Most larger jurisdictions have one or more batch-fed optical scanners, which they house in a central location to scan and tabulate mail or absentee ballots.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner gap=&#8221;30&#8243;][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/4&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;8722&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;3\/4&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"blue-text\" style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><strong>Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) Systems<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/verifiedvoting.org\/equipmentdb\/#1602531430953-70168cb5-5a1f\">Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) voting systems<\/a> use one of three user interfaces (pushbutton, touchscreen, or dial) to allow voters to record their selections directly into computer memory. DREs can support private, independent voting for individuals with disabilities by being configured with Audio-Tactile Interfaces (ATI), headphones so the voter can have the ballot read to them, or paddles or sip-and-puff devices for voters with dexterity impairments. The voter\u2019s choices are stored in DREs via a memory cartridge, diskette, or smart card and added to the choices of all other voters. Some DREs can be equipped with Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) printers that allow sighted voters to confirm their selections on an independent paper record before recording their votes into computer memory.

Unlike DREs, which record votes directly into computer memory, BMDs do not make any other lasting record of the voter\u2019s selections. Some BMDs mark pre-printed ballots, while others print summaries of voter selections, often with those selections encoded in barcodes or QR codes. Then (except in the hybrid systems described next) voters either cast their ballots on a separate hand-fed optical scanner, or place them in a ballot box to be counted centrally.<\/p>\n<p>BMDs were developed in response to the federal requirement in the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) that all polling places must provide a means for voters with disabilities to vote privately and independently. To fulfill this requirement and to broaden usability, BMDs support private, independent voting by providing screen contrast adjustment, large text, Audio-Tactile Interfaces (ATI), headphones with so the voter can have the ballot read to them, or paddles or sip-and-puff devices for voters with dexterity impairments. The first BMDs included the AutoMARK, which was purchased and subsequently manufactured and marketed by ES&amp;S, and Unisyn\u2019s OpenElect OVI-VC. New Hampshire and Oregon have also developed unique ballot marking systems. Beginning in 2014, some jurisdictions began providing BMDs for use by all in-person voters \u2014 an approach that became widespread in 2020.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner gap=&#8221;30&#8243;][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/4&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;8724&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;3\/4&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"blue-text\" style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><strong>Hybrid Voting Systems<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/verifiedvoting.org\/equipmentdb\/#1602531430842-52034776-61b3\">Hybrid voting systems<\/a> combine two functions: they allow voters to mark a ballot, and they tabulate ballots. Hybrid systems include Hybrid Optical Scan\/BMDs, Hybrid Optical Scan\/DREs, and Hybrid BMD\/Tabulators.<\/p>\n<p>The first hybrids were developed by Dominion Voting Systems, first with the addition of an assistive technology interface (ATI) to the ImageCast Precinct optical scanner and later with the ImageCast Evolution. Most often the assistive interface of the ImageCast Precinct includes a printer that prints the voter\u2019s ballot, which is then scanned by the ImageCast Precinct. The Evolution\u2019s assistive features, printer, and scanner are integrated into a single unit, although the configuration is virtually identical to a separate BMD and scanner configuration, as described in the preceding section. We have designated this equipment as \u201cHybrid Optical Scan\/BMD.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hybrid Optical Scan\/DREs are scanners that can be configured to allow voters to enter their selections from \u201cassistive ballots\u201d directly into the tabulation without the creation of an independent paper ballot, thus functioning as a DRE.

The voter\u2019s selections are printed on a voter selection card, which is scanned and tabulated by the same machine. We have designated the ExpressVote XL and the ExpressVote, when used as a BMD and tabulator as \u201cHybrid BMD\/Tabulators.\u201d While the ExpressVote XL always functions as both a BMD and as a tabulator, the ExpressVote can be configured to function exclusively as a BMD or as a BMD and tabulator.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner gap=&#8221;30&#8243;][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/4&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;8725&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;3\/4&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"blue-text\" style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><strong>Punch Card Voting Systems<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Punch Card Voting Systems employ a card (or cards) and a small clipboard-sized device for recording votes.

Some jurisdictions manually enter the votes cast by voters on absentee paper ballots into DREs rather than tabulating the ballots by scanning or manual counting.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title=&#8221;Provisional Ballots&#8221; tab_id=&#8221;provisional-ballots&#8221;][vc_row_inner el_class=&#8221;white-border-tab&#8221;][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/4&#8243;][vc_column_text el_class=&#8221;white-border&#8221;]<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1861\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Provisional_Ballot_3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" \/>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;3\/4&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Help_America_Vote_Act\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Help America Vote Act<\/a> of 2002 established that a voter could cast a provisional ballot if they believe that they are entitled to vote even if their name does not appear in the poll book. A voter must cast a provisional ballot when the voter refuses to show a photo ID if required, the voter\u2019s name does not appear on the poll book for the given precinct, the voter\u2019s registration contains inaccurate or outdated information (e.g. wrong address or a misspelled name), or a ballot has already been recorded in the voter\u2019s name. If the voter is confirmed to be eligible, the provisional ballot is counted. After the provisional ballot is determined to be valid, it is counted with a scanner or manually.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_tta_section][\/vc_tta_tabs][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;45px&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row gap=&#8221;30&#8243;][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text el_class=&#8221;red-border&#8221;]<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-8684 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/verifiedvoting.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/VV-Voting-Equipment-Banners-20222.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https:\/\/verifiedvoting.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/VV-Voting-Equipment-Banners-20222.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/verifiedvoting.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/VV-Voting-Equipment-Banners-20222-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/verifiedvoting.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/VV-Voting-Equipment-Banners-20222-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/verifiedvoting.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/VV-Voting-Equipment-Banners-20222-768x384.jpg 768w, https:\/\/verifiedvoting.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/VV-Voting-Equipment-Banners-20222-1536x768.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"red-text\" style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Voting Equipment Database<\/h3>\n<p>Some types of voting equipment are more secure than others.
