										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">To learn even more, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Byjunmc3heg">click here to watch a video explainer</a> from our team!</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we approach Election Day, it’s important to remember that we will not have the official results on election night—this is a standard part of the elections process that allows for every eligible vote to be counted and checked. As in previous elections, the results reported on election night are the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">unofficial</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> results and are</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> considered official only when certain procedures are complete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are good reasons for this post-election period: it gives election officials time to process and count all eligible ballots (also called “canvassing”), including mail and absentee ballots, provisional ballots, and ballots from military and overseas voters. Mail ballots, in particular, can take longer to process depending on the state. They need to be verified, sorted, and prepared for counting, and in some states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, mail ballots can’t even start being processed until Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quick results should never come at the expense of accuracy, and an election official&#8217;s job is not over on election night. After all of the ballots are counted, election workers check the vote count by conducting post-election audits, and in some cases, recounts. Learn more about audits and recounts by visiting our blog: “</span><a href="https://verifiedvoting.org/audits-recounts-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audits and Recounts in 2024: What’s the Difference?</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” Audits and recounts help verify election outcomes and address any discrepancies or errors before the results are certified. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After election workers count all ballots and check the vote count, the election results are certified. Certifying the election results is required by law and is considered a </span><a href="https://campaignlegal.org/update/what-election-certification"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ministerial process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; depending on the state, the certification window ranges from </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/election-certification-deadlines"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nine days to a month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The results for presidential contests have historically been certified by the Safe Harbor deadline, which is the deadline for states to choose the electors for the Electoral College. This year, the deadline is </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12682"><span style="font-weight: 400;">December 11</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">over a month after Election Day.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s easy to get caught up in the excitement and anxiety of watching the precinct reporting on election night, or to tune out once the unofficial totals are announced—but election night is not results night, and that’s ok!  After all, we need to give election officials time to check and verify the count. The strength of our democracy rests on every valid ballot being counted before declaring a winner. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following is a joint statement from Verified Voting and the National Disability Rights Network (NDRN) with recommendations to improve access and support for voters with disabilities and those with language access needs. For additional media inquiries, please contact </span></i><a href="mailto:nicole@newheightscommunications.com"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nicole@newheightscommunications.com</span></i></a></p>
<p><b>PHILADELPHIA</b> <b>(October 24, 2024)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — According to</span><a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/news/number-people-disabilities-growing-and-they-are-voting-greater-numbers"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">new data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are 40.2 million eligible voters with disabilities, yet voters with disabilities continue to face unacceptable barriers. With early voting in full swing, </span><a href="https://verifiedvoting.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verified Voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://www.ndrn.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Disability RIghts Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are committed to improving accessibility and inclusivity at polling locations nationwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is essential that we ensure every eligible voter—regardless of disability or language proficiency—can fully and independently participate in the voting process. In 2022, one in five voters with disabilities faced obstacles or required assistance to cast their ballot. Turnout is steadily rising in the disability community, and it&#8217;s our responsibility to help that number grow even more by continuing to remove barriers and make voting accessible to all,&#8221; said </span><b>Pamela Smith, president and CEO of Verified Voting.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Voting is not just a right; it’s the cornerstone of our democracy that should be accessible to everyone. It is imperative that we work collectively to dismantle the barriers that prevent individuals with disabilities from exercising their fundamental right to vote. As we strive for an inclusive electoral process, we must prioritize the needs of all voters to ensure that every voice is heard,” </span><b>said Marlene Sallo, executive director of the National Disability Rights Network.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verified Voting and the National Disability Rights Network recommend the following actions to improve the voting experience for all:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Polling places must be accessible</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">—if a location is not permanently accessible, election workers should make temporary adjustments.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Curbside voting must be available where allowed by law</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">—signage must be visible, parking must be accessible, and voters must be able to mark their ballots privately.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>At least one machine per polling place </b><b><i>must</i></b><b> be available and working</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for voters with disabilities and language access needs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Poll workers should remind every voter to check their paper ballot</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before casting it to ensure their choices are accurately recorded.</span><b>  </b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Voters must be allowed to bring a person of their choosing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">—except an agent of their employer or union—to assist them at the polls.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Jurisdictions should bring voting tools to voters where they are</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to better serve them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Jurisdictions should consider dedicating one election worker per polling place</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to focus on accessibility. This worker would ensure accessible equipment is set up and ready for voters, ensure that the location is ADA-compliant, and support voters with disabilities who need assistance.</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With November’s election here, we&#8217;ve received a lot of interest in understanding the difference between audits and recounts. Audits and recounts are two different post-election processes, but both are designed to build confidence in our elections—they help demonstrate that the winner won and the loser lost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recount and audit laws vary by state but both processes involve examining paper ballots. <em>Updated November 3, 2024</em>: <a href="https://verifiedvoting.org/publication/recounts-audits-2024-verified-voting/">Click here</a> to visit a summary table of recount and audit laws in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Visit Verified Voting’s </span><a href="https://verifiedvoting.org/auditlaws/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audit Law Database</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://verifiedvoting.org/recountlaws/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recount Law Database</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (inherited in 2024 from our friends at </span><a href="https://ceimn.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citizens for Election Integrity Minnesota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) to learn about a specific state’s laws, timelines, regulations, and procedures.  </span></p>
<h3><b>What is the difference between an audit and a recount?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A tabulation </span><b>audit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a routine part of the post-election process designed to check whether ballots were counted accurately and happens regardless of the reported election results. A </span><b>recount</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is performed in response to something that may have happened in a specific contest, such as a very close margin, and could be initiated automatically by statute or requested by candidates, voters, election officials, or interested parties. In most cases, the objective of a recount is to determine the outcome of a specific contest by counting all the ballots again.</span></p>
<h3><b>How are ballots counted? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best practices for audits include routinely examining a sample of paper ballots by hand to check the machine-tabulated results. Although some states recount ballots by hand, in most cases, recounts are conducted by re-scanning ballots and only manually examining the ballots that can’t be interpreted by the scanners.</span></p>
<h3><b>How many ballots are examined? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recount usually examines all ballots for a specific contest, and often allows the interested parties to challenge the interpretation of the voter’s intent. Audits can give confidence in the election outcome by examining only a fraction of the ballots. Many types of audits, including </span><a href="https://verifiedvoting.org/audits/whatisrla/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">risk-limiting audits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, call for examining an increasing number of ballots—even performing a full hand count—if discrepancies are identified that don’t provide adequate evidence to support the reported election outcome. </span></p>
<h3><b>When do audits and recounts happen?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audits and recounts are both post-election processes that happen after Election Day. The timing of when audits and recounts take place varies depending on the state. Audits usually begin several days after Election Day, as they often require time for contest and sample selection. Ideally, an audit happens prior to a recount and escalates to a full recount if discrepancies are found, which is why both processes are most effective when completed before the finalization of election results to ensure maximum confidence in outcomes. In our publication “</span><a href="https://verifiedvoting.org/publication/audits-recounts-nov-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coordinating Audits and Recounts to Strengthen Election Verification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” co-authored with Citizens for Election Integrity Minnesota, we also recommended that states enact well-integrated audit and recount laws, so that election officials have sufficient time to meet post-election deadlines.</span></p>
<h3><b>If there is a recount, is an audit necessary?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recount typically focuses on a specific contest. Audits, as a routine post-election practice, can give valuable information about other contests. Both audits and recounts can provide public scrutiny of our election processes and voting equipment and serve as important tools for safeguarding our elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recounts that rescan ballots, even with a different machine, still rely on technology to count ballots. When a recount rescans the ballots, a supplemental hand-count audit is critical, even if not required by law, to ensure voting equipment is accurately interpreting voter selections. Some states have adopted this best practice as part of their recount procedures. </span></p>
<h3><b>If there is not a recount, can audits help provide evidence that the election outcome was correct?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes! Routine tabulation audits are part of the continuous checks that election officials use to ensure that ballots are accurately counted. They also help identify unexpected issues that election officials can address before the results are certified. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other essential election processes are routinely audited to ensure the election runs smoothly and fairly, including signature verification, voter rolls, chain of custody, and more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">October 3, 2024</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisconsin Elections Commission</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">201 West Washington Avenue, Second Floor</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Madison, WI 53703</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via email</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>2024 Post-Election Electronic Voting Equipment Proposed Guidelines and Procedures</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Members of the Wisconsin Elections Commission:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On behalf of Verified Voting, I submit these comments on the proposed 2024 Post-Election Electronic Voting Equipment Proposed Guidelines and Procedures, prepared for the October 4, 2024 Wisconsin Elections Commission meeting. Verified Voting is a nonpartisan nonprofit organization whose mission is to strengthen democracy for all voters by promoting the responsible use of technology in elections. We believe that the integrity and strength of our democracy rely on citizens’ trust that each vote is counted as cast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post-election tabulation audits provide an important check on voting system performance and provide crucial evidence that the ballots were tabulated correctly. We applaud the measures that Wisconsin has adopted in recent years to improve and expand its post-election voting equipment audits. Wisconsin took an important step in 2018 when it first moved to pre-certification audits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We support the staff’s overall recommendation that the audit be completed prior to certification. We also appreciate the challenge of auditing elections when a recount, especially one statewide, is possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We would, however, encourage the Commission to maintain the audit as a pre-certification audit, especially if no recount takes place. The default audit completion deadline is November 25, but according to the proposed audit calendar, this deadline could shift if a statewide recount is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">possible</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For instance, if the recount petition deadline falls after November 18 and no recount petition is received, the proposed audit procedures would require municipalities to submit their audit results one day after the state certification deadline on December 1. This seems like a missed opportunity. Even partial audit results could provide the Commission, and ultimately the public, with greater confidence in the accuracy of the election results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audits have value even when a recount takes place. In Wisconsin, audits generally</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">examine more contests, and they are conducted entirely by hand, unlike recounts. The materials do offer some suggestions regarding how to coordinate these two processes. For instance, some municipalities in the past have conducted an audit directly after a recount, as a means of ensuring chain of custody for the recount. Staff also suggest that recount results for a specific reporting unit could “count” towards a municipality’s audit, if the recount were conducted by hand. Since the selection of reporting units for audit is conducted on November 6, municipalities will have early notice of which reporting units, if any, they have selected for audit and could prepare accordingly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for your consideration of these comments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respectfully submitted,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chrissa LaPorte</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior Policy &amp; Technical Associate</span></p>

<p>September 11, 2024</p>
<p>The Honorable Gavin Newsom</p>
<p>Governor</p>
<p>State of California</p>
<p>1021 O Street, Suite 9000</p>
<p>Sacramento, CA 95814</p>
<p><strong>California Voter Foundation and Verified Voting Urge Veto of Assembly Bill 2159</strong></p>
<p>Dear Governor Newsom,</p>
<p>We write to request a veto for AB 2159, which would allow electronic return of voted ballots for homeowners’ associations. The bill authorizes the use of electronic ballot return technology that has not been approved by any State of California entity, permits unregulated vendors to oversee the technology, and relies on technology that has been deemed as “high risk” by multiple federal agencies, even with security safeguards and cyber precautions in place. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) warn that <strong>electronic ballot return “faces significant security risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of voted ballots,” and explicitly recommends paper ballots.</strong>[1] Furthermore, ballots cast over the internet can be intercepted, deleted and altered at scale—and can therefore change election results.</p>
<p>The recent revelation that San Francisco’s influential Harvey Milk Democratic Club endorsement election was compromised through online voting hacking provides a stunning example of the risks associated with online voting schemes and the embarrassment, confusion and distrust such schemes breed when they fail.[2]</p>
<p>Signing this measure into law could lead to catastrophic consequences, as it may mislead California (HOA) voters into believing that this voting method is secure, despite overwhelming consensus within the scientific community and substantial evidence pointing to significant risks and insecurities.[3] This bill would spread unapproved, insecure technology that cannot guarantee voter privacy, operated by unregulated vendors to elect HOA board members who could place liens and foreclose on homes. Disregarding the existing requirements for reliable ballots in favor of an unauditable, non-recountable system weakens California&#8217;s election standards and leaves HOA voters unprotected.</p>
<p>Currently, all California voters, including those in homeowners’ associations, have the right to a voter-verified paper ballot, which can be recounted in case of questions about the election. The paper ballot provides a durable record of voter intent, unlike a purely digital record, because it is the only durable record a voter can physically examine. A digital representation on a screen can change, be modified or corrupted in capture, or be lost irretrievably. A digital representation of voter intent cannot be assured of arriving at its destination intact. This physical record of voter intent, therefore, is a standard in all California elections, and there&#8217;s no good reason to sink beneath that baseline if we are to continue to have reliable elections.</p>
<p>If Internet voting, or electronic secret ballot (which is a misnomer because there is <strong>no such thing as an electronic secret ballot</strong>), is enabled for this purpose, it eliminates that durable copy of voter intent, which the voters had the opportunity to verify. That means everyone must simply trust that the vendor&#8217;s system worked the way it was supposed to and has not been compromised, but we have no evidence to support that trust. That is corrosive to confidence in the HOA election itself.</p>
<p>We rarely weigh in on non-governmental election systems. As a policy matter affecting so many California residents and voters, and as HOA elections are quasi-governmental, this is an area that blurs the line. Requirements for reliable ballots exist in statute, and it would have negative repercussions to eliminate that more reliable system for one that provides zero auditability or recountability. This bill would lead to a weakening of California’s election standards, and leaves HOA voters unprotected. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please veto AB 2159.</span> Thank you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philadelphia, PA, USA – Verified Voting, a leading organization dedicated to strengthening democracy through the responsible use of technology in elections, is pleased to announce its participation in Access Ready Inc.&#8217;s &#8220;Stand By Me&#8221; On-Call Consulting Program. This partnership marks another action toward fostering significant collaboration between the voting security and accessible voting communities, two groups that have historically faced challenges in aligning their objectives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Working together, we hope to find a collaborative path that is inclusive of security and accessibility,&#8221; said Douglas George Towne, Chair and CEO of Access Ready, Inc. &#8220;By joining forces with Verified Voting, we are committed to creating a more inclusive electoral process that upholds both the integrity and accessibility of voting for all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are excited to collaborate with Access Ready to continue bridging the gap between security and accessibility and to ensure a more inclusive democracy for all,” said Pamela Smith, President &amp; CEO of Verified Voting. “Our vision is to ensure that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">every</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voter can cast an effective ballot without barriers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have justified confidence that their vote counts.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the &#8220;Stand By Me&#8221; program, Verified Voting will benefit from Access Ready&#8217;s expertise in accessible technology, receive guidance on best practices, and participate in strategic discussions aimed at enhancing both security and accessibility in the voting process.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">September 10, 2024</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisconsin Elections Commission</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">201 West Washington Avenue, Second Floor</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Madison, WI 53703</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via email</span></i></p>
<p><strong>2024 Post-Election Voting Equipment Audit </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Members of the Wisconsin Elections Commission:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On behalf of Verified Voting, I submit these comments on the Post-Election Voting Equipment Audit procedures in the November General Election Status Report, which was prepared for the September 11, 2024 Wisconsin Elections Commission meeting. Verified Voting is a nonpartisan nonprofit organization whose mission is to strengthen democracy for all voters by promoting the responsible use of technology in elections. We believe that the integrity and strength of our democracy rely on citizens’ trust that each vote is counted as cast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post-election tabulation audits provide an important check on voting system performance and provide crucial evidence that the ballots were tabulated correctly. We applaud the measures that Wisconsin has adopted in recent years to improve and expand its post-election voting equipment audits. Wisconsin took an important step in 2018 when it first moved to pre-certification audits. In 2020 and again in 2022, the Commission raised the cap on the number of reporting units larger municipalities were able to audit, making the audit more representative of the ballots cast in the election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We would encourage the Commission to accept the proposed 2024 voting equipment audit procedures, which require that the audit of 10% of the state’s reporting units is completed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">prior </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to state certification of the election results. An interim audit report must also be presented to the Commission before certification. Auditing election results before they are finalized is key to addressing any discrepancies that the audit might uncover. For audits to effectively build trust in election results, it is also critical that audit results are published promptly upon audit completion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for your consideration of these comments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respectfully submitted,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chrissa LaPorte</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior Policy &amp; Technical Associate</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Majority Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We, the undersigned, are writing to provide our endorsement for, and call upon you, to grant a quick floor vote on three bipartisan bills passed by the Senate Rules Committee. These bills, </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2770"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S. 2770</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3875"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S. 3875</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3897"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S. 3897</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, aim to protect federal elections from the growing threat of deceptive AI-generated content (known as “deepfakes”), as well as misinformation in elections. Timely passage of these bills is crucial to safeguard our democracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of these bills would provide valuable safeguards against deceptive deepfakes in political communications.</span></p>
<p><strong>2770, Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit the distribution of political or issue advertisements containing materially deceptive deepfakes </span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3875, AI Transparency in Elections Act of 2024</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requires  disclaimers on election-related communications that are substantially generated by artificial intelligence within 120 days of an election. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3897, Preparing Election Administrators for AI Act</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requires the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), in consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, to develop voluntary guidelines on addressing the use and risks of AI in election administration and on the spread of election-related disinformation.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our nation needs AI and elections safeguards in place before our federal elections this fall if possible. Even in these early days, we have already seen deceptive deepfakes targeting </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/ai-robocall-biden-new-hampshire-primary-2024-f94aa2d7f835ccc3cc254a90cd481a99"><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Biden</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and former </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/08/us/politics/desantis-deepfakes-trump-fauci.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Trump</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the absence of clear law, there is every reason to fear deepfakes may impact the results of close elections, enable candidates to deny the legitimacy of authentic content, sow confusion and doubt and seriously deepen political alienation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States have been very effective and fast moving at attempting to meet this challenge, with </span><a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/tracker-legislation-on-deepfakes-in-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly 20 states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, acting on a bipartisan basis to regulate AI and elections disinformation. However, these efforts leave elections in dozens of other states and the federal level unprotected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With deepfakes, the public, election integrity and candidates of all political stripes lose. The Senate should approve bipartisan proposals from the Senate Judiciary Committee to address the deepfake threat to our democracy as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for your attention to this important matter.</span></p>
